## Overview
Micky leverages OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time video captured from a webcam. The project processes video frames, identifies faces, and draws bounding boxes around them, making it suitable for applications like surveillance, human-computer interaction, or educational purposes.

## Features
- Real-time face detection and tracking using OpenCV.
- Displays bounding boxes around detected faces.
- Lightweight and easy to set up.
- Configurable for different video input sources (e.g., webcam, video file).

## Hardware Requirements
- A computer with a webcam (built-in or external).
- Arduino nano or uno
- 2xservo motors sg90s
- oled display
- external power supply for servo (optional for this project )
- 
## Circuit Connections 




## Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy (optional, for advanced image processing)
- A webcam or video input device
